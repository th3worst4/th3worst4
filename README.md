### Hi, My name is Caio Couto!

I'm 19 years old and I'm currently studying mechanical engineering at Universidade Federal Fluminense, a college in Brazil.

I started learn to code as one of my first subjects on college, when I learned the basics of Python and LaTeX. After that I had to learn Fortran 90 to write some codes for another subject. While my knowledge of Python is most turned to solve simple logical problems, in the Fortran lessons I've learned some computational math concepts.

So, in the vacation that came after, I decided to learn more languages, was with that thought I started to study C++, C and C#. In fact, I can say that at this moment, C++ is my favorite language.

Now I started to study some HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I hope that as soon as possible I can upload some project here.
