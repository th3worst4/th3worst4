### Hi, My name is Caio Couto!

I'm 20 years old and I'm currently studying mechanical engineering at Universidade Federal Fluminense(UFF).

I started learn to code as one of my first subjects on college, when I learned the basics of Python and LaTeX. After that I had to learn Fortran 90 to write some codes for Numeric Calculus.

So, in the vacation that came after, I decided to learn more languages, was with that thought I started to study C++, C and C#.
